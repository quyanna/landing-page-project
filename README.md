# landing-page-project
This is a simple landing page that I made as part of the Foundations curriculum of the Odin Project. 

This webpage was designed from scratch using a picture as a template. It uses only CSS and HTML. The main 
purpose of making this webpage was to refresh my knowledge of flexbox and positioning elements with CSS. I would like
to come back to this webpage once I learn JavaScript and improve it.  

Webpage can be accessed at: https://quyanna.github.io/landing-page-project/
